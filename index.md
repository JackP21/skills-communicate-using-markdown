This is a self imported image

These are the only size and ways to do headers for markdown.

A code example for markdown would be:
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

Finally a task list would look something like this:

- [ ] This is the first item
- [ ] this is the second
- [ ] and this is the third item
